## Introduction
`openapi-fixer` is a Go-based tool designed to help developers automatically apply fixups to OpenAPI specification files. It provides tooling to modify OpenAPI 3.0 specification file to ensure it's compatibility with various code generators and tools while maintaining the integrity of the API specification.

## Install
```shell
go install github.com/zguydev/openapi-fixer@latest
```

## Usage
```go
//go:generate go run github.com/zguydev/openapi-fixer openapi.yaml fixed.openapi.yaml --fixups ./fixups/ --config .openapi-fixer.yaml
```

## Planned

- [ ] Helper package for comon repeated schema validation and access patterns
- [ ] Feature to use YAML config files for mappings and targets instead of hardcoding to fixups
- [ ] Generic fixup types
- [ ] Logging to track fixups apply
- [ ] More descriptive error messages, include context in errors (to tell which schema/property failed)
- [ ] Fixup chaining to allow them depend on each other
- [ ] Fixups progress reporting
- [ ] Improved type safety - enums for common types
- [ ] Dry run mode to report what would change
- [ ] Feature to check what parts of spec are wrong
